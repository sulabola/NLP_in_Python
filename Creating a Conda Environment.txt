First open "Anaconda Prompt"

Type: conda env list

This will show environments available. If we have not created anything before, we will have the "base" environment.
Note: "*" indicates the active environment

To view the packages available in the environment type: conda list

-- Create an environment

Let's assume we are creating a environment called "test_env"

Type: conda create --name test_env

Proceed ([y]/n)? y

This will create a new environment

We can verify this by typing: conda env list

Now, in addition to "base" environment we will see "test_env" in the list. However, this is not active yet (check the "*")

To activate the environment type: (base) C:\Users\my_name>conda activate test_env

Then: (test_env) C:\Users\my_name>

To view the packages type: conda list

There will be no packages as we just created this.

Let's install some packages:

(test_env) C:\Users\my_name>conda install pandas

This will also install all the dependencies. Once agree it will install pandas with all the dependencies.

Now type: conda list

We can see that all the packages are there now.

Now the environment is ready. Let's launch jupyter notebook

Note: if it says jupyter notebook is not available, we can install it by typing "conda install jupyter notebook"

Note: When we are working on jupyter notebook and we want to install a new package ("spacy"), comeback to the Anaconda Prompt and open a new window.

You will in the base environment. We can change that by typing: conda activate test_env

To deactivate an environment: conda deactivate
