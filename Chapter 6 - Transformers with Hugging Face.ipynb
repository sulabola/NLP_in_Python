I use the parmesan garlic to scoop up cottage cheese as a healthy alternative to chips and dip.  My healthy eating program is saved.   \n",
       "1  I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.   \n",

They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!   \n",

They look almost like a flattened rice cake, but taste so much better, more like a potato chip. The bbq flavor is delicious. They are very low in fat and full of flavor. It is easy to eat an entire bag of these!   \n",

I use the parmesan garlic to scoop up cottage cheese as a healthy alternative to chips and dip.  My healthy eating program is saved.   \n",
       "1  I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.   \n",

They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!   \n",

The simple, engaging story introduces children to days of the week, counting, and the concept of metamorphosis. It’s a staple in early childhood education.   \n",
       "2  The Giving Tree is a touching and bittersweet story about a tree that gives everything it has to a boy over the course of his life. As the boy grows up, he takes more from the tree, and the tree continues to give, even when it has little left. Silverstein’s minimalist text and illustrations convey deep themes of unconditional love, selflessness, and the passage of time. It has sparked much discussion about relationships and sacrifice.   \n",
