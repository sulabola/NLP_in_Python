# Natural Language Processing in Python

This repository documents my learning from the Udemy course "Natural Language Processing in Python" created by Maven Analytics. The course provides a comprehensive and practical overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python, starting from foundational concepts and text preprocessing to advanced deep learning and transformer-based large language models.

The first part of the course focuses on traditional NLP methods, including text cleaning and normalization, vectorization using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, and applications such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and topic modeling using libraries like spaCy, VADER, and scikit-learn.

The second part introduces neural networks and modern NLP advancements such as transformer architectures and Large Language Models (LLMs). Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, the course demonstrates real-world NLP tasks including named entity recognition, zero-shot classification, summarization, text generation, and document similarity.
