# Natural Language Processing in Python

This repository documents my learning from the Udemy course "Natural Language Processing in Python" created by Maven Analytics. The course provides a comprehensive and practical overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python, starting from foundational concepts and text preprocessing to advanced deep learning and transformer-based large language models.

The first part of the course focuses on traditional NLP methods, including text cleaning and normalization, vectorization using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, and applications such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and topic modeling using libraries like spaCy, VADER, and scikit-learn.

The second part introduces neural networks and modern NLP advancements such as transformer architectures and Large Language Models (LLMs). Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, the course demonstrates real-world NLP tasks including named entity recognition, zero-shot classification, summarization, text generation, and document similarity.

### Chapter 1 - Natural Language Processing

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including what NLP is, how it relates to Artificial Intelligence, and real-world examples of how computers work with text data. It also provides a brief history of NLP from early rule-based systems to today’s transformer-based LLMs, outlines common NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, classification, topic modeling, summarization, and text generation, and gives an overview of key Python libraries used throughout the course (pandas, spaCy, scikit-learn, VADER, and Transformers).

### Chapter 2 – Text Preprocessing

This chapter focuses on the text preprocessing pipeline required for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It covers core preprocessing steps such as text ``cleaning``, ``normalization``, ``tokenization``, ``lemmatization``, ``stop-word`` removal, and ``part-of-speech tagging`` using both ``pandas`` and ``spaCy``. The chapter also introduces text ``vectorization`` techniques, including ``Count Vectorization`` and ``TF-IDF``, with detailed explanations of their parameters and practical Python implementations for transforming raw text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

### Chapter 3 – NLP with Machine Learning

This chapter explores how traditional machine learning methods are applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP). It introduces key machine learning concepts for NLP, reviews common algorithms used for text-based tasks, and compares traditional NLP workflows with modern transformer-based approaches. Practical applications covered include ``sentiment analysis``, supervised ``text classification`` using algorithms such as ``Naïve Bayes``, and unsupervised ``topic modeling`` using ``Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)``, highlighting how vectorized text features can be used to train and evaluate predictive models.

### Chapter 4 – Neural Networks & Deep Learning

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning as the building blocks of modern NLP. It begins with a logistic regression refresher and then explains key neural network components such as layers, nodes, weights, activation functions, and matrix-based computations. The chapter also demonstrates how to build and train neural networks in Python, discusses how deep learning extends these concepts through deeper architectures, and provides an overview of common deep learning architectures and the role of pretrained deep learning models in NLP applications.
