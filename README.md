# Natural Language Processing in Python

This repository documents my learning from the Udemy course "Natural Language Processing in Python" created by Maven Analytics. The course provides a comprehensive and practical overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python, starting from foundational concepts and text preprocessing to advanced deep learning and transformer-based large language models.

The first part of the course focuses on traditional NLP methods, including text cleaning and normalization, vectorization using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, and applications such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and topic modeling using libraries like spaCy, VADER, and scikit-learn.

The second part introduces neural networks and modern NLP advancements such as transformer architectures and Large Language Models (LLMs). Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, the course demonstrates real-world NLP tasks including named entity recognition, zero-shot classification, summarization, text generation, and document similarity.

### Chapter 1 - Natural Language Processing

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including what NLP is, how it relates to Artificial Intelligence, and real-world examples of how computers work with text data. It also provides a brief history of NLP from early rule-based systems to today’s transformer-based LLMs, outlines common NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, classification, topic modeling, summarization, and text generation, and gives an overview of key Python libraries used throughout the course (pandas, spaCy, scikit-learn, VADER, and Transformers).
